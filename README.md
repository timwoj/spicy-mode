# spicy-ts-mode

This is a very rough major-mode for Emacs to enable code highlighting. It depends on [tree-sitter-spicy](https://github.com/bbannier/tree-sitter-spicy) being installed in a way that Emacs can use it. Mastering Emacs has a [useful guide](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter) for how to set that up.

It's most-definitely missing some keywords here and there, and I'll probably be updating it as I get more into Spicy.
